Now, this problem is equivalent to the problem where we have to arrange 40 distinct R's and 60 distinct B's such that, a B should come at last. So,
the desired probability is given by 
\begin{multline}
\frac{\text{(placing a B at last)} \times \text{(arranging other letters)}}{\text{arranging 100 letters}} \\  = \frac{60 \times 99! }{100!}
 = \frac{3}{5} \label{cond/2/Eq:4}
\end{multline}
